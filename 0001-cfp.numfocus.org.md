# Single CFP site for all NumFOCUS conferences

NumFOCUS is currently using self hosted [Pretalx](https://pretalx.com/)
instances for each of the organised conference (PyData, JupyterCon, SciPy...),
Each deployment is separate which leads to a sub-optimal experience for
Speakers/Attendees:

 - Having to recreate accounts, 
 - Different domains, 
 - Difficulty to find other events. 

We suggest to experiment with  getting a yearly subscription with
[pretalx](https://pretalx.com/) to handle all the conferences in a single url.
We suggest `http://cfp.numfocus.org` to host the future NumFOCUS conferences. 

This will have numerous advantages:

  - Less strain on NumFOCUS it staff
  - Less AWS related cost to host the cfp software. 
  - Speakers will need a single account for all their past and future NumFOCUS
    conferences.
  - Single place to archive all the past NumFOCUS events. 

This should also allow simpler tracking of statistics across events, or reach
out to previous conferences speakers. 

Additionally as this service is offered by the developers of the Pretalx
software, this may help us get modification to pretalx that would simplify later
conferences.

The pretalx website suggest to contact them to get a quote for a yearly
subscriptions/multiple conferences per year. 

This proposal is supported by members of the JupyterCon 2023 organising
committee, PyData Delhi, SciPy 2023 and a recommendation from the
NumFOCUS infrastructure committee.
